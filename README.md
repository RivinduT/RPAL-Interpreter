# RPAL-Interpreter
An interpreter for the functional programming language RPAL, built with a scanner, parser, and a Control Stack Evaluation (CSE) machine. It processes RPAL source code by tokenizing input, parsing it into an abstract syntax tree (AST), and evaluating expressions using the CSE model.
